# Libft

My first 42 project: a custom C library recreating standard functions from `<string.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`.  
Serves as a foundation for future projects.  

**Key skills:**  
- C programming basics  
- Memory allocation and management  
- String and list manipulation  
- Writing clean, reusable code
