# 42 Projects

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repo collects the projects I completed during the **42 Lisboa** curriculum.  
They cover everything from low-level C programming to C++, concurrency, and Docker.  
Each project was built hands-on, with no tutorials â€” just problem-solving, debugging, and teamwork.

## ðŸŒ± What I Learned

These projects taught me to **learn fast, debug deeply, and keep building even under pressure** â€” skills I carry into real-world software development.
